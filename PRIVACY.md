# SmartSeek Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** May 17, 2025

**SmartSeek** is a Chrome Extension designed to help users automatically save and resume YouTube videos from the last watched timestamp. We care about your privacy and want to make it clear that:

- We **do not collect, transmit, or store** any personally identifiable information (PII).
- We **do not use any external servers** or analytics tools.
- All saved data (like video timestamps and titles) is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's built-in `storage.local` API.
- We **do not access, track, or store** your browsing history, personal information, or other website activity.
- We **do not sell or share** any data with third parties.
- The extension works entirely **offline** and only runs on `youtube.com`.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out via [Email](mailto:thatcoderguyshubham@gmail.com) or contact me through the Chrome Web Store listing.
